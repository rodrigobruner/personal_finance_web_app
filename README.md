## Personal finance

This innovative project empowers users to take control of their personal finances, offering an array of features designed for comprehensive financial management. Users can easily create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) bank accounts, as well as manage expense and income categories. In addition, the platform allows users to meticulously record their incomes, expenses, and transfers between different accounts. To enhance understanding, it summarizes total income and employs visually engaging graphs to illustrate expenses and income categorized by type.


The solution comprises two distinct projects: the back-end and the front-end. The back-end functions as a REST API built with Java Spring Boot, utilizing the Java Persistence API (JPA) to manage data in a MySQL database. Meanwhile, the front-end is crafted in TypeScript, employing Next.js as the framework and Material UI for the user interface components.
